		<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
		<p> Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm scales with the input size.
        It helps evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution speed and
        resource utilization. Understanding time complexity allows developers to write more efficient code and optimize performance.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Space Complexity</b>measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size.
        It is often expressed using notation like O(n), which indicates how the memory usage grows
        as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize both time and space complexity to run effectively.
